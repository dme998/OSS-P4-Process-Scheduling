/* CS4760 Project 4: Process Scheduling

oss will allocate two sections of shared memory to which user_proc will attach.
oss "schedules" and runs 10 user process back to back using a simulated clock.
oss sends exactly one message targeted exclusively at the first user process it launched. 
user_proc prints "hello world", its PID, and waits to receive a message up to a timeout period. 
  If user_proc receives its message, it will print it. 
  If it times out, it will print an error and terminate.
  
  Expected result is one user process will receive the message and the rest time out.
